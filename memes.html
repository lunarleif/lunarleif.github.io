    Memes!

  <h1 class="lewksintro">
    One of our favorite ways to interact with the fans is to see what kinds of memes they create!
    <br />
    And I gotta admit, y'all are pretty funny.
    <br />
    Here's some of my favorite "mee-mees", as Kennedy Davenport would say!

    "Come on season 6, lets get SICKENING!"
  </h1>
  <h1 class="lagdesc">
As Laganja Estranja entered The Werk Room for the first time at the start of 
<br />
Ru Paul's Drag Race Season 6, she delivered one of the most iconic lines 
<br />
throughout the entire show. It's so iconic that many queens have taken 
<br /> 
this joke and replaced it with their own season or punchline. 
<br />

     <h1 class="vanjintro">
    "Miss VANJIEEEEE"
  </h1>
  <h1 class="vanjdesc">
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo was the first queen to be eliminated from Ru Paul's 
<br />
Drag Race Season 10. As she left the stage, she walked backwards, and
<br />
repeated the phrase "Miss Vanjie". She stumped all the queens and the
<br /> 
judges too with this odd moment, and thus the queens began to repeat it.
<br />
One episode, a team of queens used "Miss Vanjie" as a safeword in a challenge
<br />
so that they knew when to transition from one bit to the next. Miss Vanjie!
<br />

  <h1 class="adoredesc">
Fans were super excited to see Adore Delano on Season 2 of Ru Paul's
<br />
Drag Race All Stars Season 2. However, on the second episode, she decided
<br />
to voluntarily leave after harsh comments from Michelle Visage. Adore and
<br /> 
Michelle were previously very close friends, even touring the country together,
<br />
so the sudden switch in behavior was too much for her. After Michelle tried to
<br />
convince her to stay, Adore couldn't do it. At first, the moment was very sensitive
<br />
and sad, but since Adore has stated that she regrets dropping out, fans have 
<br /> 
turned the previously sad moment into an iconic meme.

    "Girl look how orange you f****** look!"

  <h1 class="orangedesc">
Season 5 of Ru Paul's Drag Race is iconic for many reasons, but one of the
<br />
most prevalent reasons why was the beef between Alyssa Edwards and Coco
<br />
Montrese. To make a long story short, the pair HATED each others guts,
<br /> 
and fought at every opportunity. To make things worse, the two kept
<br />
getting paired up in challenges, so their hatred for each other grew.
<br />
While the queens were getting ready for their runway walks, the two 
<br />
started arguing about their makeup, and the infamous "Girl look how
<br /> 
orange you f****** look" meme was born.

    "Your tone seems very pointed right now."
  </h1>
  <h1 class="willamdesc">
The 4th Season of Ru Paul's Drag Race is another season that is extremely
<br />
famous, and lots of iconic moments stem from this season. One of my 
<br />
personal favorites stems from Untucked in the episode Frenemies. During
<br /> 
this episode, queens Phi Phi O'Hara and Willam had got into an argument.
<br />
Phi Phi had quite a lot of things to say to Willam about her talent
<br />
levels and outfit choices, and Willam was not having it. Instead of 
<br />
coming back at Phi Phi with an even nastier counter-argument, she 
<br /> 
very calmly delivered the line "your tone seems very pointed right now."
<br />
Fans loved it and instantly turned it into a meme.

 <h1 class="ivyintro">
    "IVYYYY WINTERSSSSSS"
  </h1>
  <h1 class="ivydesc">
Another iconic part of Season 5 of RPDR was Ivy Winters. Every
<br />
time that I, Ru, introduced Miss Winters, I always did so by 
<br />
elongating it. Instead of just saying Ivy Winters, it was always
<br /> 
"IVYYYYY WINTERSSSSSSS". I did this because Latoya Jackson once
<br />
introduced Miss Winters like this at a casino in Reno, and I
<br />
absolutely loved it. So, every time I adressed Miss Winters,
<br />
I simply had to do the same!
<br />

 <h1 class="latriceintro">
    "Get those nuts away from mah face!"
  </h1>
  <h1 class="latricedesc">
On Season Four Episode 4 of RPDR, the queens were faced with
<br />
the comedy acting challenge. On this episode, fans agreed that
<br />
Latrice Royale was comedy gold. During the episode, she played
<br /> 
a prison guard, and one of the lines that she delivered was
<br />
"Get those nuts away from mah face!" The fans absolutely loved
<br />
it.
